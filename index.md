## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3 part 1
This was my second favorite lab because we were just beginning to code. We started to incorporate functions and variables while also using inputs and outputs. While also learning what a black box is which is used for testing to ensure that our code does not have any bugs in it.


Lab 5, part 1 
 This lab was interesting about how to use statements while also incorporating more than one file. We had to create using new code to find the area of a triangle and make sure it was correct with the make command. It incorporated converting integers to a double.


Lab 8, part 2 
Lab 8 was interesting to me because I had to learn the card game poker. I always wanted to learn how to play poker and turns out we had to create the game itself from scratch.This lab was on the difficult side of things but once debugged with everything and corrected with no errors it was enjoyable to play a little game vs the computer itself.
